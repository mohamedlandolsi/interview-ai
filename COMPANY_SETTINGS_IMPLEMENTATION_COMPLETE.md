# Company Information Settings - Implementation Complete

## Overview
This document outlines the completed implementation of the Company Information settings page, including database schema, backend API, secure file storage, and frontend integration.

## Database Schema

### Company Model
Added a new `Company` model to the Prisma schema with the following fields:
- `id` (String, primary key)
- `name` (String, required)
- `website` (String, optional)
- `industry` (String, optional)
- `companySize` (String, optional)
- `description` (String, optional)
- `address` (String, optional)
- `phone` (String, optional)
- `email` (String, optional)
- `logoUrl` (String, optional)
- `createdAt` (DateTime)
- `updatedAt` (DateTime)
- `profiles` (Profile[] relation)

### Profile Model Updates
Updated the `Profile` model to include:
- `companyId` (String, optional foreign key)
- `company` (Company relation)

## Backend API Implementation

### Company Information API (`/api/company/route.ts`)

#### GET /api/company
- **Purpose**: Retrieve current user's company information
- **Auth**: Requires authenticated user
- **Response**: Returns company data or null if no company exists
- **Includes**: Profile with company relation for complete context

#### PATCH /api/company
- **Purpose**: Update existing company information
- **Auth**: Requires admin or HR manager role
- **Validation**: Zod schema validation for all fields
- **Security**: Role-based access control, company ownership verification
- **Features**: Handles empty string to null conversion for optional fields

#### POST /api/company
- **Purpose**: Create new company (for users without existing company)
- **Auth**: Requires admin or HR manager role
- **Validation**: Same schema as PATCH endpoint
- **Security**: Prevents duplicate company creation for users
- **Auto-linking**: Automatically associates user profile with new company

### Company Logo API (`/api/company/logo/route.ts`)

#### POST /api/company/logo
- **Purpose**: Upload company logo to Supabase Storage
- **Auth**: Requires admin or HR manager role
- **Validation**: 
  - File type validation (images only)
  - File size limit (5MB)
  - Company ownership verification
- **Storage**: Uploads to `company-logos` bucket with path `{companyId}/logo.{ext}`
- **Features**: 
  - Automatic old logo deletion
  - Signed URL generation (1 year expiry)
  - Database logo URL update

#### DELETE /api/company/logo
- **Purpose**: Remove company logo
- **Auth**: Requires admin or HR manager role
- **Cleanup**: Removes file from storage and clears database URL
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing files

## Supabase Storage Setup

### Storage Bucket: `company-logos`
- **Visibility**: Private (RLS enabled)
- **File Limits**: 5MB per file
- **Allowed Types**: Images (PNG, JPG, SVG, etc.)

### Row Level Security (RLS) Policies
Located in `COMPANY_STORAGE_SETUP.md`:

1. **Upload Policy**: Only authenticated users with admin/hr_manager roles can upload
2. **View Policy**: Users can only view logos from their own company
3. **Update Policy**: Only admin/hr_manager from the same company can update
4. **Delete Policy**: Only admin/hr_manager from the same company can delete

## Frontend Implementation

### CompanySettings.tsx Component
Complete rewrite with the following features:

#### State Management
- Loading states for data fetching, saving, and file uploading
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Real-time form validation with React Hook Form + Zod

#### Data Loading
- Automatic company data loading on component mount
- Form pre-population with existing company data
- Graceful handling of users without companies

#### Form Features
- **Company Information**: Name, website, industry, size, description, contact info
- **Logo Upload**: Drag-and-drop or click to upload with preview
- **Validation**: Client-side validation matching backend schema
- **Error Handling**: Field-level and form-level error display

#### Security Features
- Role-based UI (only admins/HR managers see the form)
- Secure API communication with proper error handling
- Optimistic UI updates with rollback on failure

#### User Experience
- Loading spinners during operations
- Success/error toast notifications
- Form dirty state management
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop

## Security Implementation

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Verification**: All API endpoints verify Supabase JWT tokens
- **Role-Based Access**: Only admin and hr_manager roles can modify company data
- **Company Ownership**: Users can only modify their own company's data

### Data Validation
- **Backend Validation**: Zod schema validation on all API endpoints
- **Frontend Validation**: React Hook Form with Zod resolver
- **File Upload Validation**: Type and size checks for logo uploads

### Storage Security
- **RLS Policies**: Comprehensive Row Level Security on storage bucket
- **Signed URLs**: Time-limited URLs for logo access (1 year expiry)
- **Path Isolation**: Company logos stored in separate directories by company ID

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Database Migration
```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_company_model
npx prisma db seed
```

### 2. Supabase Storage Setup
Follow the instructions in `COMPANY_STORAGE_SETUP.md` to:
1. Create the `company-logos` storage bucket
2. Apply RLS policies
3. Configure bucket settings

### 3. Environment Variables
Ensure the following are set:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key (for backend)
```

## Usage

### For End Users
1. Navigate to Settings → Company Information
2. Fill in company details (name is required)
3. Upload company logo (optional, 5MB max)
4. Save changes

### For Developers
- Company data is automatically loaded when the component mounts
- Form validation happens in real-time
- Logo uploads are handled asynchronously with progress feedback
- All operations include proper error handling and user feedback

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Company data loads correctly for existing companies
- [ ] Form validation works for all fields
- [ ] Company creation works for new users
- [ ] Company updates save correctly
- [ ] Logo upload works with file validation
- [ ] Logo removal works
- [ ] Role-based access control functions
- [ ] Error handling displays appropriate messages
- [ ] Loading states show during operations

### API Testing
Test the endpoints using tools like Postman or curl:
```bash
# Get company info
GET /api/company

# Update company
PATCH /api/company
Content-Type: application/json
{ "name": "Updated Company Name", "industry": "technology" }

# Upload logo
POST /api/company/logo
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
logo: [file]
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Team Management**: Add team member invitation and management features
2. **Company Themes**: Allow custom branding/theming per company
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Company-wide interview statistics and reporting
4. **Integration APIs**: Connect with HR systems and applicant tracking systems
5. **Company Templates**: Default interview templates per company
6. **Audit Logging**: Track changes to company information
7. **Bulk Operations**: Import/export company data

### Technical Debt
1. Replace basic toast implementation with a proper toast library (like Sonner or React Hot Toast)
2. Add comprehensive unit and integration tests
3. Implement caching for company data
4. Add database indexing for performance optimization

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Upload Fails**: Check Supabase storage bucket permissions and RLS policies
2. **Form Won't Save**: Verify user has correct role (admin/hr_manager)
3. **Data Won't Load**: Check database connection and user authentication
4. **TypeScript Errors**: Run `npx prisma generate` after schema changes

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check database connection
npx prisma studio

# Verify migrations
npx prisma migrate status

# Check TypeScript
npx tsc --noEmit

# Test API endpoints
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/company
```

## Conclusion

- ✅ Complete database schema with proper relations
- ✅ Secure backend API with role-based access control
- ✅ File upload system with Supabase Storage integration
- ✅ Modern React frontend with proper state management
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
