# 🔧 WEBHOOK SETUP FIX - Interview Results Analysis

## 🎯 Root Cause Identified

The interview results are showing nulls/zeros because **Vapi webhooks are not being triggered**. Here's why:

### Current Situation:
- ✅ Backend mapping fix is working
- ✅ API prioritization fix is working  
- ❌ **No webhook data is being received from Vapi**

### Why Webhooks Aren't Working:
1. The `VAPI_WEBHOOK_TUNNEL_URL` is commented out in `.env.local`
2. Without a public URL, Vapi can't send webhook callbacks to localhost
3. The assistant builder skips webhook configuration when no tunnel URL is set
4. Result: Interviews complete but no analysis data is saved

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE FIX: Enable Webhooks with ngrok

### Step 1: Install ngrok
```bash
# Download from https://ngrok.com/download
# Or install via npm
npm install -g ngrok
```

### Step 2: Start ngrok tunnel
```bash
# In a separate terminal, run:
ngrok http 3000
```

### Step 3: Update environment variables
Copy the HTTPS forwarding URL from ngrok (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok-free.app`) and update `.env.local`:

```bash
# Uncomment and update this line in .env.local:
VAPI_WEBHOOK_TUNNEL_URL=https://YOUR-NGROK-URL.ngrok-free.app
```

### Step 4: Restart development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## ✅ Verification Steps

### 1. Check Webhook Configuration
New interviews should now log:
```
✅ Including webhook and analysis in assistant config
🔗 Using tunnel URL for local development: https://your-url.ngrok-free.app/api/vapi/webhook?sessionId=...
```

### 2. Complete Test Interview
- Start a new interview
- Complete it (even early termination should work)
- Check results page - should show real analysis data

### 3. Verify Database
```bash
# Run this to check if new sessions have analysis data:
node debug-database-sessions.js
```

## 🔍 What This Fixes

With webhooks enabled, when interviews end:

1. **Vapi calls webhook** → `POST /api/vapi/webhook`
2. **Webhook receives data** → camelCase format
3. **Mapping function converts** → snake_case for database
4. **Database saves analysis** → real scores, strengths, feedback
5. **Frontend displays data** → actual results instead of zeros

## 🆘 Alternative: Quick Test Without ngrok

If you can't set up ngrok immediately, you can test the mapping by manually triggering the webhook:

```bash
# Test the webhook with mock data:
node debug-webhook-analysis.js
```

This will confirm the webhook endpoint and mapping are working.

## 📋 Expected Results After Fix

**Before (current):**
- Overall Score: 0
- Strengths: 0 items  
- Analysis Feedback: Empty

**After (with webhooks):**
- Overall Score: 85.5
- Strengths: 4 items
- Analysis Feedback: Detailed AI analysis
- Category Scores: Communication, Technical, etc.

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Early Termination**: Interviews ended early by users SHOULD still generate results if there's enough conversation data
2. **Minimum Duration**: Very short interviews (< 30 seconds) might not have enough data for analysis
3. **Webhook Logs**: Check browser console and terminal for webhook-related messages

The mapping fix we implemented will work perfectly once webhooks are enabled! 🎉
