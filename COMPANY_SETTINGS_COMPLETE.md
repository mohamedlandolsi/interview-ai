## Key Files Modified/Created

### Backend
- `prisma/schema.prisma` - Company model and relations
- `src/app/api/company/route.ts` - Company CRUD operations
- `src/app/api/company/logo/route.ts` - Logo upload/delete
- `src/app/api/profile/route.ts` - Updated with company data

### Frontend

### Documentation

## Toast Notifications (Sonner)

Replaced the basic toast system with shadcn/ui Sonner for better user experience:

### Success Messages
- ✅ Company information created/updated successfully
- ✅ Company logo uploaded successfully  
- ✅ Company logo removed successfully

### Error Messages
- ✅ Failed to load/save company data
- ✅ Invalid file type (non-image files)
- ✅ File size exceeded (>5MB)
- ✅ Upload/removal failures

## Next Steps

### 1. Update Supabase RLS Policies
Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor to fix the logo upload permission issue:

```sql
-- Drop existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Company logo access" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Company logo upload" ON storage.objects;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Company logo delete" ON storage.objects;

-- Recreate with correct table/field references
CREATE POLICY "Company logo access" ON storage.objects FOR SELECT USING (
  bucket_id = 'company-logos' AND 
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM profiles p 
    WHERE p.id = auth.uid() 
    AND p.company_id IS NOT NULL
  )
);

CREATE POLICY "Company logo upload" ON storage.objects FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'company-logos' AND 
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM profiles p 
    WHERE p.id = auth.uid() 
    AND p.company_id IS NOT NULL
    AND p.role IN ('admin', 'hr_manager')
  )
);

CREATE POLICY "Company logo delete" ON storage.objects FOR DELETE USING (
  bucket_id = 'company-logos' AND 
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM profiles p 
    WHERE p.id = auth.uid() 
    AND p.company_id IS NOT NULL
    AND p.role IN ('admin', 'hr_manager')
  )
);
```

### 2. Test the Implementation
1. Navigate to Settings → Company Information
2. Fill out company details and save
3. Upload a company logo (test with various file types/sizes)
4. Verify success/error toast notifications appear
5. Test logo removal functionality
