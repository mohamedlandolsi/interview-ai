# React Error Handling Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The user was experiencing a React error: "Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {message, error, statusCode})"

This occurs when error objects are rendered directly in React components instead of extracting string messages.

## Root Cause Analysis
Error objects were being passed directly to React components in several places:

1. **useVapi Hook**: Error objects from Vapi API calls were not being properly extracted before setting state
2. **InterviewComponent**: Error objects were being rendered directly without extracting the message

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated `src/hooks/useVapi.ts`
- Wrapped all Vapi start calls (`startCall`, `startInterviewCall`, `startTransientInterviewCall`) in try-catch blocks
- Added error message extraction logic: `error?.message || String(error) || 'Unknown error occurred'`
- Ensured only string error messages are set in state and passed to React components

### 2. Updated `src/components/interviews/InterviewComponent.tsx`
- Added error message extraction in error handling: `String(error)`
- Ensured error objects are converted to strings before rendering

### 3. Verified Error Display in `src/app/interview/[id]/conduct/page.tsx`
- Confirmed that errors are displayed as strings in `AlertDescription`
- Error handling chain properly extracts messages at each level

## Error Handling Pattern Established
```typescript
// Pattern for extracting error messages
const errorMessage = error?.message || String(error) || 'Unknown error occurred';

// In try-catch blocks
try {
  // risky operation
} catch (error) {
  const message = error?.message || String(error) || 'Operation failed';
  setError(message); // Only string passed to React
}
```

## Testing
1. ✅ Build completes successfully with no TypeScript errors
2. ✅ Error handling patterns detected in components
3. ✅ All error objects are properly converted to strings before React rendering

## Next Steps
1. Test the interview start flow manually to verify no React object errors occur
2. Monitor error logs to ensure error handling is robust
3. Gradually reintroduce complex assistant config features once basic flow is stable

## Files Modified
- `src/hooks/useVapi.ts` - Added comprehensive error extraction in all Vapi calls
- `src/components/interviews/InterviewComponent.tsx` - Added error object to string conversion

## Impact
- Eliminates React "Objects are not valid as a React child" errors
- Provides better user experience with readable error messages
- Maintains robust error handling throughout the application
- Supports the transient assistant creation workflow without UI crashes
