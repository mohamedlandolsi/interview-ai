## Files Created/Modified

### Backend API Routes

#### 1. `/src/app/api/profile/route.ts` - Profile CRUD
```typescript
// Handles GET and PATCH operations for user profile data
// - GET: Retrieves current user profile
// - PATCH: Updates profile information with validation
```

#### 2. `/src/app/api/profile/avatar/route.ts` - Avatar Management
```typescript
// Handles avatar upload and deletion
// - POST: Uploads new avatar to Supabase Storage
// - DELETE: Removes avatar from storage and database
```

#### 3. `/src/app/api/profile/password/route.ts` - Password Updates
```typescript
// Handles secure password changes
// - Uses Supabase Auth for password updates
// - Includes proper validation and error handling
```

#### 4. `/src/app/api/profile/delete/route.ts` - Account Deletion
```typescript
// Handles secure account deletion
// - Calls Supabase Edge Function for complete cleanup
// - Requires explicit confirmation
```

### Frontend Components

#### 5. `/src/components/settings/ProfileSettings.tsx` - Main Component
- Complete UI with three main sections:
  - Profile information form with avatar management
  - Password change form with validation
  - Danger zone with account deletion
- Uses react-hook-form with Zod validation
- Integrates all backend endpoints
- Comprehensive error handling and loading states

### Database Setup

#### 6. Supabase Storage Configuration
```sql
-- Storage bucket setup (run in Supabase SQL Editor)
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public, file_size_limit, allowed_mime_types)
VALUES (
  'avatars',
  'avatars',
  false,
  5242880, -- 5MB limit
  ARRAY['image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image/gif', 'image/webp']
);

-- RLS Policies for avatar storage
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'avatars' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);

CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (bucket_id = 'avatars' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
USING (bucket_id = 'avatars' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own avatar"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
USING (bucket_id = 'avatars' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);
```

#### 7. Supabase Edge Function for Account Deletion
```sql
-- Function for secure account deletion (run in Supabase SQL Editor)
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION auth.delete_user_completely(user_uuid UUID)
RETURNS void
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
BEGIN
  -- Verify the user is deleting their own account
  IF user_uuid != auth.uid() THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Users can only delete their own accounts';
  END IF;
  
  -- Delete user profile data
  DELETE FROM public.profiles WHERE id = user_uuid;
  
  -- Delete user interviews and related data
  DELETE FROM public.interviews WHERE interviewer_id = user_uuid;
  
  -- Delete user from auth.users (this cascades to auth.identities)
  DELETE FROM auth.users WHERE id = user_uuid;
END;
$$;
```

### Configuration Updates

#### 8. Toast Notifications Setup
- Installed `sonner` package
- Added `<Toaster />` component to root layout
- Configured for rich colors and top-right positioning

#### 9. Dependencies Added
```json
{
  "sonner": "^1.x.x" // Toast notifications
}
```

## Manual Setup Required

### Supabase Configuration

1. **Create Storage Bucket**:
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard → Storage
   - Create a new bucket named `avatars`
   - Set it as private (not public)
   - Configure file size limit: 5MB
   - Set allowed MIME types: image/jpeg, image/png, image/gif, image/webp

2. **Set up RLS Policies**:
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
   - Run the RLS policies SQL provided above

3. **Create Account Deletion Function**:
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
   - Run the account deletion function SQL provided above

### Environment Variables
Ensure these are set in your `.env.local`:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- All database operations use Row Level Security
- Avatar uploads are stored in user-specific folders
- Password changes use Supabase's secure auth system
- Account deletion uses a secure server-side function

### Input Validation
- Client-side validation with Zod schemas
- Server-side validation for all API endpoints
- File type and size validation for uploads
- Confirmation required for destructive operations

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error messages for all operations
- Network error handling with fallbacks
- Loading states to prevent multiple submissions
- User-friendly error presentation

   - Check network connectivity
   - Ensure proper API route configuration

3. **Password change fails**:
   - Verify Supabase configuration

   - Ensure user has permission to change password

4. **Account deletion fails**:
   - Verify the deletion function exists in Supabase
   - Check user typed "DELETE" exactly
   - Ensure proper authentication

### Development Tips
- Use browser dev tools to monitor network requests
- Check Supabase logs for server-side errors
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Test with different user accounts and scenarios
